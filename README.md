# Fraud Detection Using Ensemble Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project develops a scalable fraud detection system for over 6 million financial transactions. The primary challenge addressed is extreme class imbalance in fraud detection.

## Objectives
- Detect fraudulent transactions accurately
- Handle severe class imbalance
- Compare ensemble learning models
- Optimize precision-recall tradeoff

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
- Imbalanced-learn

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Handling class imbalance (SMOTE / class weights)
4. Model training:
   - Random Forest (Bagging)
   - XGBoost (Boosting)
5. Evaluation using:
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - Precision-Recall Curve
   - ROC-AUC
   -
